# vs-code-streaming

VS Code extension to display the code in a seperate window that can be used as a browser source for streaming software. This allows a display specifically adapted to the stream without having to change the display for the programmer/streamer.

## Features

- Cursor synchronization
- Syntax highlighting
- Cursor focusation
- Selection synchronization

## Requirements

To run this, you need just VS Code and any streaming software, which can run a browser window.

## Extension Settings

// TODO
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

- No Text decoration sync (At the moment not possible, because there is no way to get them over the vscode extension api)

**Enjoy!**
